	It's not just a rock. It's forty-two pounds of polished granite, with a beveled underbelly and a handle a human being can hold.<br/> Okay, so in and of itself it looks like it has no practical purpose, but it's a repository of possibility. And, when it's handled just right, it exacts a kind of poetry - as close to poetry as I ever want to get.<br/>The way it moves.... Not once, in everything I've done, have I ever felt the same wonder and humanity as when I'm playing the game of curling.
