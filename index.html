      It's not just a <b>rock</b>. It's forty-two pounds of polished granite,
      with a beveled underbelly and a handle a human being can hold.

	  Okay, so in and of itself it looks like it has no practical purpose,
      but it's a repository of possibility. And, when it's handled just right,
      it exacts a kind of <b>poetry</b> - as close to poetry as I ever want to get.
      <br/>
      The way it moves.... Not once, in everything I've done,
      have I ever felt the same <b>wonder</b> and humanity as when
      I'm playing the game of <b>curling</b>.
