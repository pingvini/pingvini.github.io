These days I am working on some exciting functionality for our page. In the future it will be possible to see live scores of our games.
Our first test run of the feature will be form the 6th to the 8th of September when we will play at the Eastern European Curling Cup in Bratislava as part of our preparations for the ECC in October.

I know there is not a lot of curling fans in Slovenia and even fewer that would be interested in this. The few that are will hopefully appreciate it and we look forward to any comments sent to our <a href="{% include email %}">team mail</a>.
